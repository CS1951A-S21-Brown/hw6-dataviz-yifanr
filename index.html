            <h3>Written Questions</h3>
            1. For question 1, I show how many titles list each genre found in the dataset. I provide the
            option to filter so that only movie genres or TV genres show up, or both. It clearly shows
            how many titles per genre there are.
            <br>
            For question 2, I provide a scatterplot of the average runtimes of movies over the years. Hovering
            over a plotted point provides exact information about that point. This shows the general trend of
            average runtime by release year.
            <br>
            For question 3, I show the top 40 director/actor pairs for movies or TV by number of movies
            made together.
            <br><br>
            2. First, D3 allowed me to write general code for bar graphs that could change according to data,
            and were created without me having to find out anything about the data beforehand. I could also
            use this code to show graphs for other data without much work.
            <br>Second, D3 allows me to quickly and easily change the parameters, filtering by movie or TV
            show with the click of a button, and presenting the data in the same clean manner.
            <br>Third, my scatterplot allows for tooltips showing up, to give exact data if wanted for
            any one plotpoint, and it's infeasible to show all the labels due to how crowded the points are.
            <br><br>3. First, if the data is not in an accessible format for a computer, it may be easier
            to use another tool. The work it takes to load bad data into a csv could be more work
            than simply choosing another tool.
            <br>Second, if you don't need the more advanced features offered by D3, I feel that
            simply using google sheets or excel to create a line graph would be more time efficient
            than using D3 to create it.
            <br>Third, if you need data visualization real time, I imagine that it would be inefficient
            to constantly load the database in and render it again. I recall that excel's graph functionality
            changes the graph as the source data in the spreadsheet is updated.
            <br><br>4. People who have somewhat weak vision should still be okay since I refrained from
            using light colors in my bar graph with a white background. I also don't have anything color-coded,
            so no information is really hidden by color. <br>
            If the user is blind, it would be
            quite difficult for them to visualize the data even though there are captions and labels that
            the reader could use. I could improve upon this by adding summaries of the data under the graphs
            and providing the key points, like "the top 3 genres were... with ... entries respectively".
            This would make it easier for blind people to get the main points of the data. I got this from
            one of the readings and thought it was a good idea. Additionally, I could perhaps learn to add thin black
            borders around the bars to make the contrast even better while still keeping aesthetics.
            <br><br>5. I suppose that using all dark or black colored bars would make it easier for more people
            to see, but I felt that it was ugly and tried to strike a balance between contrast and aesthetics.
            To save time, I did not add a description/summary of key points of the data under each graph,
            even though that does seem like a good idea to make it more accessible to blind people. That would probably
            be the next thing I'd do if I were trying to improve accessibility. I suppose the 80/20 principle
            that one of the readings mentioned is at play here for me. I could also try adding more informative captions.
